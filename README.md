# Food_Menu
The Food Menu Web App is a simple interactive project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Users can add food items with category (Veg/Non-Veg) and price, which are displayed dynamically in separate menus. Bootstrap cards provide a responsive design while JavaScript handles input, storage, and DOM updates.
